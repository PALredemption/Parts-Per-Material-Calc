# Parts-Per-Material-Calc
A simple parts per material calculator using custom tkinter and HTML.

Throughout this project, I learned how to use HTML. Prior to this project, I had no idea you could generate an HTML page with Python. It was interesting to see how formatting a page and assigning variables to it works.

Using this program is simple:
- Input the dimensions of your material
- Input the dimensions of the flat part you want to cut
- Input the size of the gap you want
- Click 'Calculate' to view the amount of parts you can fit, as well as the percentage of material used per part
- Click 'View Model' to open a window that displays a demo you your material and parts
- Click 'View HTML Report' to export

Thanks!
